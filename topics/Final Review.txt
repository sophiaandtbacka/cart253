Revisit your programming knowledge at the start of the course and compare it to what you know now. What are the most significant changes?

Discuss the relationship between your new programming knowledge and your creative practice. This can include elements that you are comfortable with, but also things you’re challenged by but want to work on incorporating into your creative coding practice. What can you do now as an artist who codes?

Look to the future of your role as a creative coder. How much closer are you to owning that role? How has your understanding of creative code changed? What are you looking forward to being able to do in the future?

Significant Changes
Thinking in JavaScript 
	how to think, really like learning language akin to learning grammar of a language 
	understanding rules and way JavaScript processes information and limitations and how to circumvent those limitations or connect other languages like html and css

Confidence and Demystification
	Before had minor experience with Java but none with JavaScript or p5 and at a base level	
	Before only had two coding projects ever
	Now much more confident
	Understand and comfortable with GitHub
	Lot less mystery around coding and all that, feels much more approachable
	Big confidence thing

!Debugging!
	Before had no idea how to debug, this was one of my biggest chokeholds in terms of advancing
	Now confident with debugging and process of understanding why my code isn't working
	Understand my common problems
		i.e. mismatched naming, wrong syntax, using p5 functions outside of setup or draw, p5 needs to be initialized in order to use p5 functions, not assigning values to variables (defined variable it but maybe left  x as 			undefined and then never assigned value), = vs == vs === 
	Confidence with accessing console and interpreting console messages 
	Know how to use console.log to track when function being called 

New Concepts that Not yet fully confident in but have used
	New is arrays,
		Still not completely confident but used of text strings 
	New concepts gamification
		Scoring
		Acceleration
		Speed
		Determining Overlap with dist
		Timing elements 

Creative practice 
Interactive art
	Never really made any interactive art, before just focused on creating visuals through photography illustration that create certain experience based on leveraging visual/design elements to create a certain vibe and meaning
		Now audience experience based on audience engagement
		Art that changes on your actions with it
		So cool
		Completely different thinking
	Architecture Background 
		functions as a bridge between pure visual art and interactive art
		in architecture think about how building and space moves you and what pulls your attention, all about creating moments 
		architecture is interactive in the space that you are moving and many times unexpected uses, building shell through time molds to its use, ex. railing on outside used as skating rails, edges used as sitting spaces
		cool taking concept of interaction and pushing it way further with computation and event functions

Chance/Experimentation/Unexpected 
	Less hands on now and less attached to my vision of exactly what the final project has to be
	Computation great from iterative design
		can change one variable and have a completely different result in 5 sec
		also can allow space for more chance and experimentation because quick iterative aspect of computation
		introduced more chance in art, allow for unexpected results
		this the unexpected many times much better than planned 
	My Context
		Previously in jewelry very preplanned and precise have to have extremely SOPs that's based on materials used and limitations of design, ex. you cannot set an opal in white gold
		Also jewelry is very expensive so it can be very consequential if you have a failed experiment

Introduction to Computer Environment
	Coming from a very limited practice heavily bound by physics and materiality
	Can have huge amount of complexity, often unachievable in physical world
	Can create environments and effects that follows different set of rules not bound to gravity or the foundational rules of our environment 


Future
Giving Thanks/Accrediting openness in mentality and understanding wide range of possibilities with coding
I love that I learned with Pippin, didn't have a strict definition of this is what coding is and this is what you're going to do with it
Open ended projects was awesome 
I was not limited to how to code a traditional gaming structure 
Instead pushed to engage with true creativity and out of box thinking
Take one small idea and push it all the way

Take Away
	Traditional games: games with specific goals and rules
	Not super interested in traditional games which is common path but really like creating interactive visuals
	Interested in creating unexpected visuals and patterns 
	I want to push iterative design and interactive design

Interdisciplinary Future
!Coffee Book!
I would love to create a coffee book of prints/visuals created by p5 with code next to it
	In this project also would love to integrate poetry into commenting in p5 code
	Accrediting Tasha
		Introduced me to the possibility of artistry in commenting in coding

Interactive Video Installation
	Layer interactive code on top of video/film
	Disney Wand logo vibe

!Narrative Video Project!
Layer code and video
Use eye tracking when looking at a video and eye movement, visualize this movement works like a paintbrush on top of video
I would also love to do this with watching old videos, nostalgia moments, I believe layering this code would give first person narrative insight
	Camera capture framing representation of past perspective 
	Eye tracking framing representation of current perspective
		ex. image video of group of friends taken when your first love was just an acquaintance, in capture this person will be a side character but eye tracking every time they are on screen 
		immediately look at them and stare at them until they're out of frame
		could layer synth type music to show current emotive perspective 

Sound Jewelry 
	Create rings that track something from exterior, movement/direction/heartbeat and create sounds based on that 

Color Glass
	Color changing lens glasses based on some sort of event
