## Description
 This is an interactive art piece and self-portrait exploring my bipolar disorder.
 
 The user begins on a sterile, clinical start screen where a monotone lecture plays —
 setting a mood of detached malaise.
  
 At the center, a clear white-outlined gem represents the “clinical” simplification
 of a complex inner experience.
  
 The screen splits like a playing card — a black side depicting a drawn figure of depression,
 and a white side showing an uplifted figure of mania.
 
 Moving the cursor over the gem prompts an interaction: pushing the user to take
 either the “depressive pill” or the “manic pill.”
  
 Upon clicking a pill, a medicine bottle rattling sound plays as the scene transitions slowly
 into either the depressive or manic screens.
  
 Each of these states is visualized through the new color grading of the gem facets,
 representing the multiple layers and versions within depressive and manic experiences.
